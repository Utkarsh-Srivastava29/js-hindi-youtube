"use strict";//treat all the JS code as the newer version


//we cannot use the statement below becuase most of the people who will teach us will teach us in the html or the developer console
//kyunki javascript ka engine browser ke anar chhupa hua hai
// alert(3+3);//we are using node.js and not the browser
//we avoid semicolons in most of the scenarios



console.log(3+3)//code readibility should be very high so we shoud not just give irrelevant indenation in the above and that is it about the above
console.log("hitesh")



let name ="hitesh"
let age=18
let isLoggedIn=false
let state=null//we can give a single empty value to the above
//ab maan lo hum kuch temperature dena chah rhe hain lekin server agr hamein zero bhej dega to wo to ek temperature and we cannot send that temperature in the system because it cannot send the temperature





//number=>2 to power 53
//if my number is large enough then we can go wih bigint
//string==>double quote ""
//boolean=>true/false
//null==>js mein ek datattype hai lekin standalone value bhi hai ye above waali cheezein
//undefined
//symbol=>unique


//object 
console.log(typeof "hitesh");
console.log(typeof null);//object
console.log(typeof undefined);//undefined

//null ka type object hai->very important interview question
